Release notes GitHub TrueWidget displays macOS version, CPU usage and local time on screen at all times.\nIt stays displayed in front of regular applications, so it is never hidden. ✨ Check macOS version and host name at a glance when using multiple versions of macOS on your Mac. ✨ The CPU usage can be monitored not only by instantaneous usage, which can vary widely, but also by a moving average, which is less likely to be blurred, to determine recent trends.\n✨ The local time can be displayed in a size that is easy to read unlike the time on the menu bar, which is not legible when using high resolution.\n✨ Supports multi-display environments and allows control over which screen is used for display. ✨ When the mouse hovers over the widget, it automatically turns transparent, enabling normal interaction with the application behind it.
