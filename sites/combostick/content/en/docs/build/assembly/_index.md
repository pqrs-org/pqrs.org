6.  Lastly, ensure that the stick cover is fully pressed in.
    When fully inserted, there should be a gap of about 2mm.

    Additionally, when the stick is tilted, the stick cover will contact the base, preventing the metal stick from touching the base.
    This gap between the metal stick and the base is crucial because if they touch, the metal stick will gradually wear down, leading to catching during operation.
