To use the ComboStick, you need to configure the software on macOS and assemble the hardware.
First, ensure that the software works before proceeding with the hardware assembly.

The required software is [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/).
After installation, try remapping a few keys on your keyboard to ensure Karabiner-Elements works correctly.
