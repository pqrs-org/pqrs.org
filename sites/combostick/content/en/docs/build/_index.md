ComboStick is not commercially manufactured. It’s a device you build yourself.

There are two types: the Basic model and the Advanced model:

|                      | Basic Model | Advanced Model |
| -------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Mouse feature        | ✓           | ✓              |
| Built-in USB hub     | -           | ✓              |
| Detachable USB cable | -           | ✓              |

In any case, you can easily assemble it with a few readily available components, a 3D printer, and a soldering iron.

Because the Basic model requires fewer parts, it’s a good idea to start with it.
You can upgrade to the Advanced model later by adding additional parts.
