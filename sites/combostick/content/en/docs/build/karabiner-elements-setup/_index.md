Once you have all the materials, before disassembling the Logitech F310, make sure it works properly on macOS.
To use the Logitech F310 as a mouse, you need to install [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) on macOS.

After installing, switch the Logitech F310 to DirectInput mode, then connect it to your Mac. Since the ComboStick will use the Logitech F310 upside down, hold it upside down during this setup as well.

In Karabiner-Elements, enable “Logitech Dual Action” from the Devices section. Then, enable “Flip mouse X, Y,” “vertical wheels,” and “horizontal wheels.”

With this setup, you will be able to control the mouse cursor movement and scrolling using the stick.
