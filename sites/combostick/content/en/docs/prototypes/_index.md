## Prototype #1

This is the first prototype. At that time, the wrist rest was still low and had a flat shape.

## Prototype #2

This model angled the stick closer to the keyboard.
However, this made the stick operation feel unnatural, so I concluded that angling it wasn't a good idea.

## Prototype #3

This model was installed upside down.
Without modifying the F310's circuit board, this was the closest to an optimal design, and I used this model for quite a long time.

## Prototype #4

Due to wear and tear, the stick cover broke, so I 3D-printed a new one.

## Prototype #5

Finally, this is the model where I started modifying the circuit board.
I removed the potentiometers that were making the board thicker and switched to a detachable USB cable.

## Prototype #6

The gamepad had many buttons, but their positions and the feel when pressed were not ideal.
So, I reduced the number of buttons to two and used Cherry MX switches instead, which made clicking much easier.
This model is close to the final version.

## Prototype #7

This model incorporates a USB hub to connect a YubiKey, and I also added a USB-A port to connect a keyboard.
The case was packed tight with the Cherry MX switch base and cables, making assembly quite difficult.

## Prototype #8

This model reduced assembly difficulty by attaching the Cherry MX switches directly to the top case.
The hub's position was also moved to make assembly easier.
