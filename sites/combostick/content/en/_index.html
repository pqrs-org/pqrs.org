    This is a joystick-operated mouse designed to keep your hands on the
    keyboard.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's made by modifying a commercially available Logitech F310 Gamepad, which
    can be obtained at a low cost. The exterior can be produced with a 3D
    printer.
  </p>

  <p>
    As it is, it's recognized as a joystick, so it needs to be used with
    Karabiner-Elements on macOS to work as a mouse. The power of
    Karabiner-Elements, this setup has the following features, offering
    advantages that other pointing devices don't have.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The left stick controls pointer movement, while the right stick handles
      scrolling, allowing both actions to be performed with the same tilting
      motion.
    </li>
    <li>
      When using one stick for cursor movement or scrolling, it allows for slow
      and precise control. Tilting the second stick while doing so adds
      additional speed, enabling a wide range of actions from delicate
      adjustments to large movements with ease.
    </li>
    <li>
      As long as the stick is tilted, it continues to provide input. This is a
      major advantage when scrolling infinitely or moving across a large screen
      in any direction.
    </li>
  </ul>
