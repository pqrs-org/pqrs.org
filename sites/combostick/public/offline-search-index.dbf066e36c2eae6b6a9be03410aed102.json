It's made by modifying a commercially available Logitech F310 Gamepad, which can be obtained at a low cost. The exterior can be produced with a 3D printer. As it is, it's recognized as a joystick, so it needs to be used with Karabiner-Elements on macOS to work as a mouse. The power of Karabiner-Elements, this setup has the following features, offering advantages that other pointing devices don't have. The left stick controls pointer movement, while the right stick handles scrolling, allowing both actions to be performed with the same tilting motion. When using one stick for cursor movement or scrolling, it allows for slow and precise control. Tilting the second stick while doing so adds additional speed, enabling a wide range of actions from delicate adjustments to large movements with ease. As long as the stick is tilted, it continues to provide input. This is a major advantage when scrolling infinitely or moving across a large screen in any direction.
