Use a soldering iron to melt the solder and remove the parts, then use desoldering braid to clean up the remaining solder.\nThe USB cable is detached to remove the ferrite core. The central rod (LED) is removed to reduce the height. The switches for LB and RB are removed to replace them with Cherry MX switches. The orange parts of LT and RT are removed to reduce the height. After removing the parts Before ➡️ After ➡️ ➡️ Snip the cables Cut the removed USB cable to a convenient length and strip the insulation.\nCut the 2-pin Connector with Wires and strip the insulation.\nSolder the parts to the circuit board Solder the following parts onto the circuit board.\nUSB Cable: Qty: 1 The wire color is V D+ D- G- 10k ohm variable resistors: Qty: 2 The orientation of the resistor doesn’t matter. To prevent interference with the case, bend the leads inward as you attach them. 2-pin Connector with Wires (female): The color of the wire doesn’t matter. Solder the wires to Cherry MX Switches Bend the switch pins, then solder the wires. The color of the wire doesn’t matter.\nVerify the functionality With the soldering complete, connect the Cherry MX switches to the circuit board, and then connect the board to macOS via USB. Ensure that the stick and buttons are working correctly.\nTuning the variable resistor The variable resistor is configured so that changing the resistance triggers button7 and button8.

Attach the parts and Cherry MX switches to the top case, and connect the cables. Be sure to pay attention to the orientation when installing the parts. Close the case with nuts and bolts, attach the stick cover. Lastly, ensure that the stick cover is fully pressed in. When fully inserted, there should be a gap of about 2mm.\nAdditionally, when the stick is tilted, the stick cover will contact the base, preventing the metal stick from touching the base. This gap between the metal stick and the base is crucial because if they touch, the metal stick will gradually wear down, leading to catching during operation.

Assembly"},{"body":" ComboStick A mouse for macOS that combines and operates two sticks simultaneously How to build your device GitHub Usage Pointer control Mouse cursor movement begins by tilting the left stick. While only the left stick is used, the pointer moves slowly. If you tilt the right stick while the left stick is sufficiently tilted, the pointer accelerates. The right stick doesn't influence the direction of the pointer's movement, so you can tilt it in whatever direction is easiest for you. Scroll Tilting the right stick first, as opposed to the pointer control, initiates a scrolling action. Ergonomic This mouse uses a joystick attached to a wrist rest for moving the pointer and scrolling, enabling you to operate the mouse without removing your hands from the keyboard.\nInexpensive This device is made by slightly modifying the circuit board of the affordable Logitech F310 and combining it with a 3D-printed case.\nSmooth operation By using two sticks simultaneously, one for directional control and the other for speed control, this device achieves a balance between precise and high-speed operations.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" ComboStick A mouse for macOS that combines and operates two sticks simultaneously How to build your device GitHub Usage Pointer control Mouse cursor movement begins by tilting the left stick.
