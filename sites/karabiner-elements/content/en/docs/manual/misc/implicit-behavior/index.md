Karabiner-Elements modifies following behavior automatically without any configurations:

## Share state of modifier keys with all connected keyboards

When you are using multiple keyboards, modifier keys are shared with all keyboards.

For example, pressing "shift key on keyboard1" and "space key on keyboard2" sends shift-space.

{{% alert color="info" %}}

## Other obsoleted features

### Add fn-key combinations

Karabiner implicitly changes fn-key combinations in Karabiner-Elements 15.0.0 and earlier.

| Key combination | Result         |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| fn-up arrow     | page up        |
| fn-down arrow   | page down      |
| fn-left arrow   | home           |
| fn-right arrow  | end            |
| fn-return       | enter          |
| fn-delete       | forward delete |

{{% /alert %}}
