Karabiner-Elements modifies following behavior automatically without any configurations:

## Share state of modifier keys with all connected keyboards

When you are using multiple keyboards, modifier keys are shared with all keyboards.

For example, pressing "shift key on keyboard1" and "space key on keyboard2" sends shift-space.

## Add fn-key combinations (only for Karabiner-Elements 15.0.0 and earlier)

{{% alert title="Notes" color="primary" %}}
This fn-key combinations were removed in Karabiner-Elements 15.1.0.
{{% /alert %}}

Karabiner adds fn-key combinations:

### fn-arrow keys

| Key combination | Result    |
| --------------- | --------- |
| fn-up arrow     | page up   |
| fn-down arrow   | page down |
| fn-left arrow   | home      |
| fn-right arrow  | end       |

### others

| Key combination | Result         |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| fn-return       | enter          |
| fn-delete       | forward delete |
