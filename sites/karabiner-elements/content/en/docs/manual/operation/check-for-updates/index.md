You can check for updates from Update tab.

## Using the latest beta version

Karabiner-Elements also offers beta builds so you can try in-progress features early.
These builds do not check for updates automatically,
but if you're interested you can look for and install updates manually using the "Check for beta updates" button.

They're generally stable enough for everyday use and rarely cause issues.
However, new features under development may still change before they ship in a release build,
so please keep that in mind when using new features.
